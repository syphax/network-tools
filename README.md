# network-tools

This repo contains some privately-developed scripts for supply chain network analyses.

Unless otherwise specified, all scripts in this repo were developed by myself or my family members on our own time, without reference 

As this repo is meant as a learning tool, the algorithms used focus on clarity and rely more on brute force than elegance or performance.
