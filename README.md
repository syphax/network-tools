# network-tools

This repo contains some privately-developed scripts for supply chain network analyses.

Unless otherwise specified, all scripts in this repo were developed by myself or my family members on our own time, without reference to published algorithms or methods.

As this repo is meant as a learning tool, the algorithms and techniques focus on clarity and rely more on brute force than elegance or performance. 

In the age of fast computers, expensive humans, and medium-sized datasets, brute force is often under-rated.
