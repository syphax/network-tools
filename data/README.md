# Data

## US Population by ZCTA
This data is actually hard to extract from https://data.census.gov/; I found a dataset [here.](https://blog.splitwise.com/2013/09/18/the-2010-us-census-population-by-zip-code-totally-free/) 
It's fine for our purposes.

File: `2010-pop-by-zcta.csv`

## US Zip Code Lat/Lon
Lightly edited for ease of use (added headers, removed a couple columns)

File: `US-zip-lat-lon.csv`

(Yes, we're mixing ZIP and ZCTA data here...)
